# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for building a machine learning model to determine the sentiment of restaurant reviews. The model is trained using a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which consists of restaurant reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle: Link to Dataset. It contains a collection of restaurant reviews, each labeled as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the review.
